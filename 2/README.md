# Fibonacci Sequence

## Objective 1: Write the Fibonacci Sequence by hand
* Write out the sequence
### Questions
* What is the pattern?
* Is there a stopping condition?
* Does this work on negative numbers?

## Objective 2: Write a function that will print out these numbers
* Write a function that will write out this sequence for you
### Questions
* Do you know the efficiency of your function? (you don't have to know the
Big-O notation, although that would be nice)
* How can you check the efficiency of your function?
* Can you write the function another way, to improve efficiency?

## Objective 3: Recursion versus Iteration
* You may have written your function recursively. If you have, write it using
iteration. If your wrote your function iteratively, now write it recursively.
### Questions
* Why could it be useful to know how to write a function that accomplishes the
same thing iteratively and recursively?
* Is there an efficiency gain doing it one way over the other?
* Is there a way to make a recursive function as efficient as its iterative
counterpart?
