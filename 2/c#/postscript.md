# Lessons from C#
* Tail recursion and iteration run at the nearly the same efficiency. However,
tail recursion is always faster than iteration. If you run this multiple times,
you'll see that they are very close, but iteration is always slower.
* Tail recursion is the fasted way to go, if you are faced with a recursive
problem.
