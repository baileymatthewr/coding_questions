# Lessons from C++
* Essentially the same as C
* Tail recursion and iteration run at the same efficiency. The precision of the
clock doesn't clearly show this, but application proves that they clearly run
at the same efficiency.
* Non-tail recursion is many orders of magnitude slower. C++ expects you to be
smart enough to know when you write something that is inefficient. This is due
to the stack frames generated by fib1()
* Tail recursion or iteration are the best ways to go, if you are faced with a
recursive problem.
