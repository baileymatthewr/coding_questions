# What can be gained from this coding question?
## Watch the candidate write the code
* Does the person have a language they gravitate to?
    * Does the person feel comfortable writing in this language without the
    help of an IDE?
* Does the candidate know how to explain what they are typing out?
    * For languages like C,C++,Java where certain libraries must be imported in
    order to print messages out to the screen, have they memorized these?
## Does the candidate understand "syntactic sugar"?
* Part of this question is understanding how much time the candidate has spent
trying to understand the inner workings of this type of a langauge. Is it
apparent that he or she has tried digging into it?
* Would the candidate struggle understanding why a for-loop utilizes a
while-loop and what that relationship consists of?
* How confident is the candidate in the answers he or she gives?
## Is the outcome of objective 3 a surprise to the candidate?
* The fact that the outcome is surprising to a candidate isn't necessarily a
problem. There is a problem if he or she thinks there is some type of a
mistake. This is usually an indicator that the person doesn't follow the
scientific process. We should all be willing to trust the language design and
tried and tested compilers enough to know that they should be trusted over our
judgement.
* Does the candidate understand the outcome? Can the candidate describe what is
occurring in a coherent and concise way?
