# Coding Questions

### Why does this exist?
* There are many coding questions that exist out there. This isn't a place to
keep track of the ones that exist. This is a collection of questions I have
devised or have heard and enjoy.
* The questions aren't necessarily difficult, but they show how a person goes
about solving the problem.
* Some questions need a bit of background information either before or after
the question. I will do my best to list these preconditions and postconditions
with each question.
* There is a practical value to going through these problems, even if there is
no immediate application.

### What if something is wrong?
* I am a very adaptable person. If you find something that is wrong, send me a
message and explain what's wrong.
* This is a public repository, you can:
    * submit a PR and I can merge in the corrections
    * fork the repository and modify it as you'd like
* You could set up a blog where you point out all of the failures of this
repository to prove how awesome you are.
* **THE BOTTOM LINE** - I think anyone could benefit from taking the time with
this repository and working through the problems, even if they don't
particularly enjoy them.
