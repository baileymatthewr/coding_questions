# Coding Questions

### Why does this exist?
* There are many coding questions that exist out there. This isn't a place to
keep track of the ones that exist. This is a collection of questions I have
devised or have heard and enjoy.
* The questions aren't necessarily difficult, but they show how a person goes
about solving the problem.
* Some questions need a bit of background information either before or after
the question. I will do my best to list these preconditions and postconditions
with each question.
* There is value to going through these problems, even if there is no
immediate application.

### What if something is wrong?
* I am a very adaptable person. If you find something that is wrong, send me a
message and explain what's wrong.
* This is a public repository, you can:
    * submit a PR and I can merge in the corrections
    * fork the repository and modify it as you'd like
* You could set up a blog where you point out all of the failures of this
repository to prove how awesome you are.
* **THE BOTTOM LINE** - I think anyone could benefit from taking the time with
this repository and working through the problems, even if they don't
particularly enjoy them.

### Installing the languages on your machine

#### C#

You can install C# on nearly any operating system now. The following website
will allow you to get the version necessary for your environment.

You still will need the Windows download even if you plan to use it through
WSL.

For WSL, you also need to follow these steps to get it properly installed:
