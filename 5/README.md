# Count the Bits that are On in a Byte

## Objective 1: Determine a test to ensure that you can count correctly
* What makes a good test to get started?
* What are tests you can use along the way to ensure your solution?

## Objective 2: Write out a solution based on a bit array
* Check that you can count the bits that are TRUE
* Check that the position of the bits makes no difference

## Objective 3: Write out a solution based on a char
* Check that you can ensure accuracy with your solution
* Check that your solution doesn't stop or interfere with the last solution
